### Description
We all experienced frustration of using WYSIWYG editor especially when switching between Visual and HTML modes. 
If you have a need to use Visual editor in your day-to-day operations, but you also need the ability to have some posts or pages in pure HTML format - HTML Mode Locker allows you to do that on per-post basis.
